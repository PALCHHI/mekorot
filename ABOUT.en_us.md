# About Mekorot Rashi

A Hebrew/Latin typeface in the Rashi style. Originally this project was part of an attempt to create a free version of the Hebrew Talmud, as PDF files, while keeping the original page's shape (known as 'Tzurat Hadaf'). This repository has been adapted from a previous [Sourceforge archive](http://mekorot.sourceforge.net), based on the original work by Dr. Alan Hoenig [here](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hebrew/makor/).

In 2021 this project was reengineered by Eli Heuer for inclusion in the Google Fonts catalog.
