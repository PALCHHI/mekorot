FONTLOG for Mekorot Rashi
-------------------

This file provides detailed information on the Mekorot Rashi font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Demo fonts
and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
--------------------------

A Hebrew/Latin typeface in the Rashi style. Originally this project was part of an attempt to create a free version of the Hebrew Talmud, as PDF files, while keeping the original page's shape (known as 'Tzurat Hadaf'). This repository has been adapted from a previous [Sourceforge archive](http://mekorot.sourceforge.net), based on the original work by Dr. Alan Hoenig [here](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hebrew/makor/).

In 2021 this project was re-engineered by Eli Heuer for inclusion in the Google Fonts catalog.


Security and Integrity
-------------------------

The following signatures are valid for the source files and the final pdf:
