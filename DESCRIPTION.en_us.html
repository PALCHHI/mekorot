<p>A Hebrew typeface in the Rashi style. Originally this project was part of an attempt to create a free version of the Hebrew Talmud, as PDF files, while keeping the page shape known as Tzurat Hadaf.</p>

<p>This project has been adapted from a previous <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mekorot/">SourceForge archive</a>, based on the <a href="https://ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hebrew/makor/">original work by Dr. Alan Hoenig</a>.</p>

<p>In 2023 this project was reengineered and redrawn by Eli Heuer for inclusion in the Google Fonts catalog. The Latin typeface included is a fork of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spectral">Spectral</a>.</p>
